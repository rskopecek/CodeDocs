At the moment, this is a new (or restarted) project.  

Since most of the initial focus is around collaboration of what things to include versus how to design/code it,
the following are the 2 areas of contributing:

* Discussing and collaborating on the issues
* Reporting bugs in as-is functionality

When the versions increase to a level where a unified design direction is solidified, pull requests will be reviewed/accepted.
